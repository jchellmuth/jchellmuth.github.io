title: Posting Rmarkdowns to your Jekyll website

### Introduction
This website is generated through Jekyll and hosted on Github Pages. 
I won't go into details about how to build your Jekyll website on Github because there is a ton of excellent documentation out there and you'll easily find many useful blog posts. The most important documentation to get you started is here:  
- [Github Pages](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages)  
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) (including a quick start guide)
I personally think Github + Jekyll is a great place to host your personal website - even if you are not a professional coder.  

As a physician scientist working in basic cancer biology, I mainly use the R environment for my research. I have long documented important analysis with Rmarkdowns that I knit to html or pdf files. Generating html or pdf files from Rmarkdowns is super easy in Rstudio - see [here](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) for documentation.

Now, if you want to share your Rmarkdown on your Github/Jekyll website, there are some small caveats that need to be addressed to make that work smoothly. Below, are two solutions depending on whether you want to upload html files or markdowns. The following steps and description assume you generate your content locally and the upload / push it your github repository. 

### Option 1: Uploading a complete / allinclusive html files
When you generate html files form an Rmarkdown, the images that you code might produce are all rendered into that html file. So, when you upload and post that html file to your github page, you don't need to specify any links or worry about paths to the images you want to display. The disadvantage however is that the html file won't conatin any front matter and, more generally, changing / formatting the finished html file is more tedious than editing a markdown (at least for html rookies like me).
The fix for the front matter issue is simple: simply open the html file in any editor and add something like to following front matter to the file:
``` {YAML}
---
layout: post
title:  "Plotting 3C data with ggplot"
date:   2020-01-03 21:56:01 +0100
categories: code visualization
---
```
You can now simply move the edited html file to your `_posts` folder and viola - you have your post. 
Although this works perfectly fine, it could become tedious if you post a lot and have to do it for every post (which is why I prefer Option 2).

### Option 2: Uploading a markdown
The great thing about Github and Jekyll is that it automatically renders your markdowns (but not Rmarkdowns!) to html which is then displayed on your site. 
Going from an Rmarkdown to a regular markdown is simple enough in Rstudio. However, to be able to post this markdown on your Github/Jekyll site, the followiing issues need to be taken care of:
- make sure you preserve / carry over the front matter 
- links / paths to image files generated during the first knit need modified

The following front matter will knit your Rmarkdown to a markdown (specifically, the github variant) and carry over your YAML haeder by setting  `preserve_yaml: true`.
``` {YAML}

```

When you knit your Rmarkdown to a markdown, image files generated by the script are placed into a subfolder and the markdown will contain links to those images. By default, these links won't work on your Jekyll website - whether they are relative or absolute. Furthermore, having subfolders for each post will crowd your `_posts`. It's more practical to store your image folder in an `image` folder in you main directory - especially if you want to use them elsewhere on your site.  
Setting the following `knitr` options will  
- store images generated by knitting the Rmarkdown to markdown in the `images` folder  
- change make the links / paths to images in your markdown work on your Github/Jekyll website  
``` {r}
knitr::opts_knit$set(base.dir = "/Users/jch/web/jchellmuth.github.io/", base.url = "/")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.path = "images/")
```
After knitting, you should have your markdown (`.md`) in the `_posts` folder which is where I also keep the Rmarkdown (`.Rmd`). The images generate during that knit will be in your `images` folder. Feel free to check out my github website repository where I use this very setup to publish R code.

Assuming you are working on your Jekyll site and its content locally and have git set up, push the changes to your repository as usual:
``` {bash}
git add .
git commit -m "new post"
git push origin master
```
