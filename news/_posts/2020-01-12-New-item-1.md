### Introduction

3C data measuring the interaction frequency between two genomic
coordinates can be represented graphically in different ways. Often,
simple barplots are used and comics are drawn to indicate the genomic
position of anchors and restriction fragments of interest. However, this
can be tedious and errorprone.
3C data can also be represented as arcs spanning from the anchor (aka
viewpoint) to the regions of interest (aka restriction fragments)
rendering a precise illustration of the genomic context. In these plots,
the interaction frequency correlates with the hight of the arc. A
published example of such a plot can be found
[here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26308897).
To my knowledge, there is no R package that conveniently generates this
kind of plot. Below is my ggplot solution to generate ‘3C arc plots’.
Feel free to email me with any questions, improvements or comments.
