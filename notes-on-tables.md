## Notes on tables:
- kramdown supports tables without headers (which I like) and is used by jekyll.
- tables in kramdown / jekyll require a preceeding empty line (this line doesn't have to include a line break).
- it seems that there is no way to make markdown previews in atom use kramdown. Thus, tables will not render properly here.
- To get a better preview of tables, I usually add a line-break (2x space) after each row (however, this is not required to Jekyll).
