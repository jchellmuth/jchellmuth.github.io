Publication highlights:
publication highlights are rendered in a table. 
Vertical table borders were removed by changing settings in the `_base.scss` file
`border-left: none; and border-right: none;`  
and the table background was set to $background color

SEO:
to exclude certain pages from search engines, I am doing two things 
1. Exclude from sitemap file (which helps google to crawl the page).
This is done by setting `sitemap: false` in the YAML front matter
2. Use the robots meta tag
General information can be found here:
https://developers.google.com/search/reference/robots_meta_tag
The Jekyll solution I implemented is from this blog post:
http://longqian.me/2017/02/12/jekyll-robots-configuration/
Briefly, this was added to the `_includes/head.html` file:
{% if page.robots %}
<meta name="robots" content="{{page.robots}}" />
{% endif %}
Then, the following tag is added to pages that you don't want to appear in search engine results:
robots: noindex
This will lead to the following robots meta tag in the final html:

For now, I am excluding my CV and cooking page incl. all recipe posts from search engines.

Notes (from Jekyll website):
Kramdown is the default Markdown renderer for Jekyll.
By default, Jekyll uses the GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) processor for Kramdown.
