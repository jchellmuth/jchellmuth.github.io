This recipe is originally from: The Cookery Year, Reader's Digest, 1984

# Ingredients

|Whipping cream|500 ml|1 imperial pint|  
|Icing Sugar|60 g|2 oz|  
|Salt|pinch|    
|Amarettini / macaroons|200 g|  
|Sherry|90 ml|3 fluid oz|  

# Notes
* Sandeman Dry Sherry has worked well so far.
* The original recipe calls for 3/4 double cream and 1/4 pint single cream. You can replace this with 1 pint whipping cream.
* The original recipe calls for 12 macaroons. 200gr Amarettini have worked well instead.
* 1 imperial pint ≈ 568 ml; 1 US pint ≈ 473 ml
* 1 imperial fluid oz ≈ 28.41 ml; 1 US fluid oz ≈ 29.57 ml
* 1 oz ≈ 28.3 g (same in UK and US)

# Preparation
* Whip Cream with powdered sugar and a pinch of salt until the mixture is firm but not stiff.
* Freeze cream until nearly solid (in a loaf tin or tupperware).
* Crush amarettini / macaroons into fine crumbs and set aside 1/3 for decoration.
* Break up frozen cream and blend in sherry and 2/3 of the macaroon crumbs with a whisk.
* The mixture should stay light and bulky. Add sugar or sherry if necessary.
* Re-freeze mixture.
* Invert container onto a serving plate. Use hot water or a hot towel to make the ice drop out.
* Press the macaroon crumbs lightly into the top and sides of the ice with a broad-bladed knife.
