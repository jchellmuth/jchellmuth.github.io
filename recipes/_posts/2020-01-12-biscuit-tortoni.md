# Ingredients

|Whipping cream|470 ml|1 imperial pint|  
|Icing Sugar|57 gr|2 oz|  
|Salt|  
|Amarettini / macaroons|200 gr|  
|Sherry|90 ml|3 fluid oz|  

# Notes
* Sandeman Dry Sherry has worked well so far  
* The original recipe calls for 3/4 double cream and 1/4 pint single cream. You can replace this with 1 pint whipping cream. 
* The original recipe calls for 12 macaroons. 200gr Amarettini or Amaretti di Saronno have worked well instead. 
* 1 imperial pint ≈ 568 ml; 1 US pint ≈ 473 ml
* 1 imperial fluid oz ≈ 28.41 ml; 1 US fluid oz ≈ 29.57 ml
* 1 oz ≈ 28.3 g (same in UK and US)

# Preparation
* Whip Cream with powdered sugar and a pinch of salt until th emixture is firm but not stiff.
* Freeze cream until nearly solid (in loaf tin or tupperware).
* Crush amarettini / macaroons into fine crumbs and set aside 1/3 for decoration.
* Break up frozen cream and bleand in sherry and 2/3 of the macaroon crumbs with a whisk.
* The mixture should stay light and bulky. Add sugar or sherry if necessary.
* Re-freeze mixture.
* Invert container onto a serving plate (use hot water or hot towel to make ice drop out)
* Press the macaroon crumbs lightly into the top and sides of the ice with a broad-bladed knife.
