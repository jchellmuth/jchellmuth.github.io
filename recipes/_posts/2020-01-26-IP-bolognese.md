Adapted from "Il cucchiaio d'argento" (Der Silberl√∂ffel) to work in an Instant Pot. Optionally, I add bay leaf and dried herbs for a fuller flavor. Note that some recipes add pancetta or bacon for a heartier version.

# Ingredients
  
|Lean minced beef|1 kg|or use half pork, half beef|  
|Canned, chopped tomatoes|4||  
|Carrots, finely chopped |4|  
|Celery sticks, finely chopped |4|  
|Onions, finely chopped |2 large or 3 medium|  
|Garlic, miced |4 cloves|  
|Red wine |half a bottle|  
|Tomato paste |2 tbsp|  
|Bay leaf |1 large or 2 small|  
|Dried Thyme, Rosermay, Oregano|optional|  
|Salt and Pepper|to taste|  

# Preparation
* Using the saute funtion of the IP, brown miced meat
* add carrot, celery and onions and continue to sautee until softened
* add tomato paste and garlic
* add canned tomatoes, rinse cans with water and add to pot
* add bay leaf and dried herbs (if desired)
* add as much wine as IP will hold (2/3 mark on the inside of pot)

* For a rich/deep flavor, continue to simmer ad libitum and/or reheat the next day adding water or wine whenever the bolognes turns too dry
