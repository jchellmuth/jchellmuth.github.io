This recipe is originally from: my mum

# Ingredients

|Grieß / fine grit|80 g||  
|Whipping cream|200 ml||  
|Vanilla pod|1||  
|Sugar|200 g|? oz|  
|Eggs|2, separated|    
|Grand Marnier|50 ml|  
|Gelatine|7 pieces (7 blatt)||  

# Notes
* Original recipe calles for 300ml whipping cream. Sarah prefers this reciped less cream heavy.
* Vanilla sugar works well as replacement for the vanilla pod.
* The original recipe calls any orange liqueur. I ihave found that Grand marnier works well.
* I have found that the grits cool very well in cool water bath (cool tap water will do). I find this preferable to placing a warm dish into the fridge. Stirring from time to time is advised.


# Preparation
* Heat milk with 160g sugar and scraped out seed of 1 vanilla pod.
* Add grits to boiling milk and stir until mixture thickens to a porridge-like consistency.
* Fill grits to a new bowl and add 2 egg yolks.
* Soak gelatine in water. 
* Warm orange liqueur a little and dissolve gelatine. 
* Add gelatine to grits and cool mixture in fridge or cool water bath.
* Whip cream.
* Whip egg whites with remaining sugar (40 g).
* As soon as grits have cooled and started to solidify around the edges, add whippind cream and then add stiff egg whites.
* Transfer mixture to serving bowl and place in fridge for >3h.
