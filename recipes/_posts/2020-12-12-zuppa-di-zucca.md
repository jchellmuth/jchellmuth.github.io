The following recipe is from ,The River Cafe Cook Book' by Rose Gray and Ruth Rogers.

# Ingredients
Serves 6

|Pumpkin|1.5 kg|seeded and diced into 5cm cubes|  
|Potatoes|150 g|peeled and diced| 
|Red onions (small)|2|finely chopped|    
|Garlic|2 cloves|cut into slivers|  
|Chicken stock|1 litre||  
|Fresh Majoram|4 large sprigs||  
|Dried chilis|1-2|optional|  
|Olive oil|3 tbsp||  
|Butter|50 g||  
|Parmesan to serve||  

Notes
* This is a very thick soup.  
* Vegetable broth instead of chicken broth works as well.  
* The original recipe recommends serving with Crostini (Ciabatt bread + garlic + olive oil)
* Variation according to original recipe (which I haven't tried yet): add 150g cooked canelli beans when you add the pumpkin. Reserve some whole ones to add to the final puree. 

# Preparation
* Heat oil and butter in a large, heavy saucepan and gently fry the onion until soft.
* Stir in the garlic, majoram leaves, pumpkin and potatoe.
* Season with chili (optional), salt and pepper. 
* Add enough stock to just covver the pumpkin.
* Simmer until until the pumpkin is tender, about 20-25 minutes.
* Option 1 (simpler and preferred):  
    * Mix entire soup using a hand blender. 
* Option 2 (original recipe):
   * Strain about a third of the stock from the pumpkin and set aside
  * Mix remainder in a food processor (very thick!)
  * Return to saucepan and add back the stock you removed. 
* Serve with Parmesan and Crostini
