# Ingredients
|Cabbage / Weißkohl / Spitzkohl|1|  
|Onions|2|
|Sugar|5 Tbsp or 50 gr|
|Salt|2 Tbsp|   
|Pepper|to taste or 1 tsp|  
|Olive oil|150 ml|  
|Vinegar|300 ml|  
|Carbonated water|700 ml|  

# Notes
* If possible, use shallots instead of regular onions.
* The original recipe (CK/Brigitte) calls for the above liquid amounts which seems to assume a very large cabbage. For a small cabbage (especially Spitzkohl), use approx half. 
* The original recipe calls for 1 cup sugar.
* One alternative recipe found online calls for 200ml Olive Oil, 500ml Vingar, 2l water and 5 Tbsp sugar (with a 1.5kg cabbage).
* For Vinegar, 'Käuteressig' should be used. Cider vingar / 'Apfelessig' has also worked well.

# Preparation
* Finely chop or grate cabbage 
* Thinly slice onions and mix with cabbage
* Mix remaining ingredients to a dressing
* Add dressing to cabbage and toss
* Place a plate with weights atop the cabbage and let sit 24h
* Tip out fluids and serve
